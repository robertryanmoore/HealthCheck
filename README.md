One of my tasks at Old Mutual was to perform QA health checks 3 times a day. This got boring after about 2 days. I automated the task using Selenium Web Driver. The program automatically runs at the set times and checks that the system is up and if not, reports at which point it fails. The source code is available but for security reasons, links and user login information have been removed. Thus the program cannot run.
